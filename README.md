## WHY?
- The Custom Builder-based version is ugly and not very intulictive

## HOW IT LOOKS:
![image](https://github.com/P4NTY/CBR-PNK-FOUNDRY/blob/main/assets/image.png?raw=true)
- The left button is adding and the right button is decreasing values
- GLICHED status can also be given with the middle mouse button.
- Selecting the value of the APPROACH and Skills by clicking on the label

## To do:
- Threat card
- NPC card
- Taking the text to the language packages

## To FIX:
- Detection of throw by dice so nice
- Version detection by Foundry
- Improving the version-lifting manifest
